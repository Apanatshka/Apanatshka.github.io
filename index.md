I am a PhD student in the [Programming Languages Research Group](http://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at Delft University of Technology. My research focus is the specification of static program analysis in the form of data-flow analysis. For this purpose I've designed FlowSpec, a domain-specific language for the specification of data-flow analysis. FlowSpec is part of the [Spoofax Language Workbench](http://spoofax.org). I am supervised by [Eelco Visser](http://eelcovisser.org).
