My name is Jeff Smits. I'm a PhD Candidate at Delft University of Technology. I'm part of the Programming Languages Research Group, where I work on static analysis of programming languages but on the meta-level in the Spoofax Language Workbench. If you're wondering: I didn't write about any of that work on this blog, this is just about my side-projects (so far anyway).
