I published my first crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io)! It's called [`aterm`](https://crates.io/crates/aterm), and it's a library that implements the Annotated Term format. Currently it can only parse and print the normal textual format, but I'm planning to add the other three formats too at some point. There are also a number of other improvements that I have planned. But I'm going to try to not make this post a braindump of meandering thoughts. So here's what I'd like to talk about today:

* What are ATerms
* Why did I implement a library for them
* What's in the Rust library, and what did I learn while designing/using it
* What happened to the automata benchmarking post

# What are ATerms



# Why did I implement a library for them

# What's in the Rust library, and what did I learn while designing/using it

# What happened to the Implementing Finite Automata (Part 3)?

Eh, whatever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
