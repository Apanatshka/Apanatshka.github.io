Allo world. It is I, LeClerc.  
Yeah, that was bad. Ok, let's not do bad puns. I'll try to stay serious
here. *Puts on serious face.*

So here's the deal: I'll write about some CS related things that I know.
That helps me retain and improve my knowledge, and gives me a chance to
practice writing. You gain yet another place on the internet to read
about random CS stuff. Maybe you'll like my way of writing. And if you
don't, then you can just move along. There's no comment section at this
time and I don't plan to add one. If this blog becomes a big thing and
people want to comment on posts (yeah right, how likely is that), I can
probably start a subreddit or something. 

Here's my planning for now:

 - Release a post on the basics of "graphs"
 - Move on through automatons, towards parsing, in several posts
 - Meanwhile find a consistent writing style and post length
 - Continue an old hobby/investigation into different parsers/parsing
   strategies and report on them
 - Get side-tracked by other stuff.. Wait no, I was going to try to
   avoid that! Aargh..

(Maybe I should reconsider the "no bad puns"?)
