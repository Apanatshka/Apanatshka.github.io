I've purchased a domain name: jeffsmits.net. This weblog is now on [blog.jeffsmits.net](). I've 
made sure this blog stays available from the old URLs, but I can't guarantee that new content will 
be available there. One of the perks of having a domain name is that you can switch around the 
back-end that hosts the content. For now the hosting is still [GitHub 
Pages](https://github.com/Apanatshka/Apanatshka.github.io), but that may change at some point in 
the future (I don't have concrete plans yet). To stay up to date I do advise RSS subscribers to use 
the feed through the new domain so you don't lose your subscription when I swap out the back-end. 

Sorry about the lack of posts in the last few months. I have a small post lined up for next
week[^health], and I plan on picking up the once every 3-5 weeks blog post schedule again. 

I know `.net` was originally intended to be used for networks. And I don't usually consider myself 
a collection or network of cells but more a single entity. But `.net` has long been used for things 
other than the original intended use-case of networks[^net-domain] so whatever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

[^health]: Hopefully, if health allows, stupid cold virus >:(
[^net-domain]: Like personal domains which don't have a super weird/cheesy/hipster TLD
